Hello Jenkins
-

Testing an instance of continuous delivery using open source such as
Github. The purpose of this is to lay the foundation of deployment to a server by following
GitFlow. Next steps is to find a affordable cloud server hosting service.

Or I might do this in the basement.

Update: I went with Digital Ocean. Nice... This is kinda fun.

npm install
npm test
then a deploy script which I will move into an npm task instead.
boo
