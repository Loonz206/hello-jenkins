Hello Jenkins
-

This repo is a example of CI/CD working with UI code following a pattern of having a Githook plugin Service activated on this repo that a Jenkins Server that I have running in a instance of Digital Ocean. One server watches the Github repo then runs install, tests and if successful deploys to another server where the code is hosted.

I am working on a blog post on showing how this is done.
